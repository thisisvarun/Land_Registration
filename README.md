# Blockchain Land Registration System

A decentralized application for land registration and property transfers built on Ethereum blockchain with a React frontend.

## Overview

This platform revolutionizes traditional land registration by leveraging blockchain technology to create an immutable, transparent, and secure system for property ownership records. By eliminating intermediaries and reducing paperwork, the application streamlines property transfers while maintaining a tamper-proof history of all transactions.

## Features

- **Secure Property Registration**: Register land and property details on the Ethereum blockchain
- **Ownership Verification**: Verify property ownership through cryptographic proof
- **Transfer History**: View complete, immutable history of all property transfers
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated property transfers through Ethereum smart contracts
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive React-based frontend for easy interaction
- **Document Storage**: IPFS integration for storing property documents
- **Digital Signatures**: Cryptographic signatures for transaction authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels for property owners, buyers, and government authorities

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Web3.js, MetaMask integration
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Development Environment**: Truffle/Hardhat, Ganache
- **Testing**: Mocha, Chai
- **Additional Storage**: IPFS (for document storage)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- Ganache (for local development)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-land-registration.git
   cd blockchain-land-registration
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start local blockchain (if using Ganache)
   ```
   ganache-cli
   ```

4. Deploy smart contracts
   ```
   truffle migrate --reset
   ```

5. Start the React application
   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Connect MetaMask to your local blockchain or the appropriate Ethereum network

## Usage

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask) to the application
2. Register as a property owner or buyer
3. For property registration, submit required details and documents
4. For property transfer, connect with the buyer/seller and initiate the transfer request
5. Confirm transactions through your connected wallet
6. View property history and verify ownership details

## Smart Contract Architecture

The system is built on the following core contracts:

- **LandRegistry.sol**: Main contract managing property records and ownership
- **PropertyTransfer.sol**: Handles the transfer of property between users
- **DocumentVerification.sol**: Manages document verification and IPFS integration
- **UserIdentity.sol**: Handles user identity verification and permissions
